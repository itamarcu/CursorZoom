# DEPRECATED!
# Please use [Zoom/Pan Options](https://github.com/itamarcu/ZoomPanOptions) instead. That module includes per-player settings, smoother zoom, and touchpad support.

# Cursor Zoom

FoundryVTT module to change mouse scroll zooming - it will center around the cursor instead of around the center of the screen.

This does not affect PageUp, PageDown, or Numpad +/-. Those will still zoom into or out of the center of the screen.
